# Lab 5: Interrupts

**Advanced interrupt handling and real-time programming techniques for responsive embedded systems**

---

## Overview

Lab 5 focuses on advanced interrupt handling and real-time programming techniques essential for responsive embedded systems. This lab teaches students about interrupt service routines, priority management, and real-time system design principles.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand interrupt mechanisms and vector tables
- Implement interrupt service routines (ISRs)
- Design priority-based interrupt handling systems
- Master real-time programming techniques
- Handle multiple concurrent interrupt sources

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Interrupt System Setup
- Configure interrupt vector table and priority levels
- Set up interrupt enable registers and control bits
- Initialize interrupt sources (timers, GPIO, UART, etc.)
- Test basic interrupt functionality

### 2. Interrupt Service Routine Design
- Implement efficient ISR functions
- Handle interrupt context saving and restoration
- Design minimal processing in interrupt context
- Implement proper interrupt acknowledgment

### 3. Priority Management
- Configure interrupt priority levels
- Handle nested interrupt scenarios
- Implement priority-based task scheduling
- Test interrupt preemption and nesting

### 4. Real-Time System Integration
- Integrate interrupts with main program flow
- Implement real-time task scheduling
- Handle timing-critical operations
- Optimize system responsiveness

## Technical Implementation

The interrupt system implements priority-based interrupt handling with efficient service routines and real-time task processing. Key technical aspects include:

- **Vector Table Management**: Proper interrupt vector configuration and handling
- **Priority Control**: Hierarchical interrupt priority management
- **Context Management**: Efficient register saving and restoration
- **Real-Time Processing**: Time-critical operation handling

## Performance Optimization

Critical optimization techniques for interrupt handling:
- **Minimal ISR Processing**: Keep interrupt service routines as short as possible
- **Efficient Context Switching**: Optimize register save/restore operations
- **Priority Optimization**: Balance interrupt priorities for system performance
- **Memory Management**: Efficient use of stack and global variables

## Testing and Validation

### Functional Tests
- **Interrupt Triggering**: Verify all interrupt sources trigger correctly
- **Priority Testing**: Confirm interrupt priority and preemption behavior
- **Nesting Test**: Test nested interrupt handling
- **Timing Test**: Measure interrupt response times

### Performance Tests
- **Latency Measurement**: Measure interrupt response latency
- **Throughput Test**: Test interrupt processing throughput
- **Stability Test**: Extended operation under interrupt load
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor stack and memory usage

## Troubleshooting Guide

- **Interrupts not triggering**:
    - Check interrupt enable registers and configuration
    - Verify interrupt source configuration
    - Test interrupt vector table setup
    - Check global interrupt enable status
- **Priority issues**:
    - Verify interrupt priority configuration
    - Check for priority conflicts
    - Test interrupt preemption behavior
    - Review priority assignment strategy
- **System instability**:
    - Check stack overflow conditions
    - Verify proper context saving/restoration
    - Test interrupt nesting limits
    - Review ISR processing time
