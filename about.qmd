    <h3 class="card-title">Problem-Solving Philosophy</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p>I believe in a systematic approach to engineering challenges:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Understanding the Problem</h4>
    <p>Thoroughly analyzing requirements, constraints, and stakeholder needs before jumping to solutions.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Research & Analysis</h4>
    <p>Investigating existing solutions, best practices, and emerging technologies that could inform the design.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Iterative Design</h4>
    <p>Building prototypes, testing assumptions, and refining solutions based on real-world feedback.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Documentation & Communication</h4>
    <p>Clearly documenting decisions, processes, and outcomes to enable knowledge sharing and future improvements.</p>
