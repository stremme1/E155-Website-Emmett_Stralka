### Problem-Solving Philosophy

I believe in a systematic approach to engineering challenges:

#### 1. Understanding the Problem
Thoroughly analyzing requirements, constraints, and stakeholder needs before jumping to solutions.

#### 2. Research & Analysis
Investigating existing solutions, best practices, and emerging technologies that could inform the design.

#### 3. Iterative Design
Building prototypes, testing assumptions, and refining solutions based on real-world feedback.

#### 4. Documentation & Communication
Clearly documenting decisions, processes, and outcomes to enable knowledge sharing and future improvements.
