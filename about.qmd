## My Approach to Engineering {.section-title}
:::

::: {.about-section .scroll-animate}
I believe in a systematic approach to engineering challenges:

**1. Understanding the Problem** - Analyzing requirements, constraints, and stakeholder needs
**2. Research & Analysis** - Investigating existing solutions and emerging technologies
**3. Iterative Design** - Building prototypes and refining solutions based on feedback
**4. Documentation & Communication** - Clearly documenting decisions and processes
