    "text": "Reflection\nWatching Episode III again, I was struck by how much the film balances political intrigue with personal tragedy. Anakin’s internal conflict is central, and Hayden Christensen’s portrayal really conveys the tension between his loyalty, fear, and ambition. I also appreciated how the film connects the prequels to the original trilogy, giving context to Darth Vader’s character and the Empire’s rise."
