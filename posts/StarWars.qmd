## Summary

*Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* is the culmination of the prequel trilogy, showing Anakin Skywalker’s tragic fall to the dark side and the rise of the Empire. The film covers critical events like the Clone Wars ending, Order 66, and Anakin becoming Darth Vader. Visually, it features stunning space battles, lightsaber duels, and iconic planets such as Mustafar and Coruscant.

## Reflection

Watching Episode III again, I was struck by how much the film balances political intrigue with personal tragedy. Anakin’s internal conflict is central, and Hayden Christensen’s portrayal really conveys the tension between his loyalty, fear, and ambition. I also appreciated how the film connects the prequels to the original trilogy, giving context to Darth Vader’s character and the Empire’s rise.  

The emotional weight of the final scenes, especially the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan, left me reflecting on choices and consequences. While some dialogue and pacing felt uneven at times, the story succeeds in showing how hope, friendship, and fear can shape destinies in ways that are often irreversible.
